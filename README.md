# React-Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio was created using my new React skills, which sets me apart from other developers whose portfolios don't use the latest technologies. This portfolio was deployed to GitHub Pages. It is a responsive, multicolor page using React and CSS. For each project that is featured in the portfolio, there is an image of the application with a link to the deployed project.
